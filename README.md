Sitemap for the UCAR Office of General Counsel

This Sitemap was created to document the Information Architecture (IA) for Office of General Counsel section of the UCAR 
President's Office website. It is intended purely for documentation and communication purposes, and not for website navigation.

The visual style of this document is achieved by means of the awesome SlickMap CSS, which is a super fast and easy way to
visualize IA. It's totally free to use and reuse. For more info please see https://github.com/rizkysyazuli/SlickMap-CSS
